     <section class = "about"> Hello! I'm Alicia Forstner born and raised in Wisconsin. 
        I attended college at UW-Oshkosh to finish pursuing my
        degree in graphic design. However, life took a crazy turn and I ended up being 
        a managing partner of a restraurt with my then and now boyfriend for 4 years, who is an excellent chef. In spring of 2019 we decided we are 
        both too young and we have so much yet to learn and grow from other people and experiences. We decided to move on. 
        Very bittersweet. After I was able to visit my sister in Cali twice, vist my friend in Hawaii for my golden 30th, and attending all of my good friends
        weddings. All of that lead me here today, starting a new chapter and new career! I can't wait to see how it unfolds!
